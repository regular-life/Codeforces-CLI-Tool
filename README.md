```

## Getting Started:

- Ensure that you have the required packages installed and add the project directory to your `PATH` using the provided installation script.

- Please read and make necessary changes in `config/config.yml`. Additionally, check and define `YOUR_TERMINAL_RC_FILE` in `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install-venv-setup.sh`.

- Although `encrypt.py` is currently unused, it will be implemented soon. Or maybe some other encryption format (I need to search for something like this).

- This project has been developed and tested on Arch Linux. While efforts have been made to ensure compatibility with different operating systems, flawless performance on all platforms is not guaranteed.

- Run `cftool` with the desired options to interact with Codeforces effortlessly.

## Future Targets:

We are actively working on improving cftool. Future features may include:

- Problem recommender system.
- Support for additional online judges.
- Option for password reset.
- Encryption-Decryption of username and password.
- Password reset option.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- Bash
- Selenium for Web Scraping
- Requests library for CodeForces API
- YML for config
- OOPS applied where possible
- Pytz & tzlocal library
