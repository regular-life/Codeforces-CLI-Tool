how-to-run:
    Main.py is the Main running code: use this to write code for commands etc
    helper functions in utils
    class CF in classes
    read config/config.yml else, you may get error
    compiler to submit on is auto selected (read from the file extension being submitted)

how-it-works:
    username, password are saved locally in secrets/credentials.json
    config/config.yml has an option whether the browser should be displayed or not
    code first asks for file path to submit on
    then asks for username, password if they are not saved
    if config/config.yml has been set to true, code is submitted directly and result displayed on terminal
    else user is prompted to type question id
    code is submitted, and then after some time result is displayed along with submission time

behind-the-scenes:
    use virtual environment already set up using "source /.env/bin/activate"
    authentication, submission is done using Selenium
    submission status is fetched using CodeForces API
    encrypt.py has not been used, i am receiving lots of errors when using it
